  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: November 25, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>NoBsApplications</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
    handles information when you use the <strong>Swipe Delete</strong> mobile application
    (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable
    information or usage data from users of the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any settings or preferences you adjust within the App are stored locally on
    your device and are not transmitted to us.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect any personal data, we do not use your data for
    analytics, advertising, tracking, or any other purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks,
    crash reporting tools, or other tracking services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not store your personal data on our servers. Any information
    related to your use of the App (such as preferences or local data) remains
    on your device under your control.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is designed for general use and can be used by people of all ages.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from any users, including
    children under the age of 13.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all App data stored
    on your device. If your device offers additional privacy controls (such as
    app permissions), you may adjust them at any time through your device
    settings.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
    update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use
    of the App after any changes are posted will mean you accept those changes.
  </p>
